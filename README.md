# Portfolio Project
This is a simple, but mostly complete html portfolio website for a school project. This is very similar to how I prepare and send websites to my clients and for example purposes, the client's name is 'Someone'.

## Updates
- 3/30/2023: The website is just about complete, I've added all the necessary pages. Next, you might want to look into adding some php and create a CMS for your blog as at the moment you would have to add new blog posts and update the links which will get exhausting over time.
