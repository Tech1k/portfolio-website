# Portfolio Project
This is a simple, but mostly complete html portfolio website for a school project. This is very similar to how I prepare and send websites to my clients and for example purposes, the client's name is 'Someone'.

For the time being, an example of this website is available at: <a href="https://portfolio.kk.dev">portfolio.kk.dev</a>.

## Updates
- 3/30/2023: The website is just about complete, and I've added all the necessary pages. Next, you might want to look into adding some PHP and creating a content management system (CMS) for your blog because as of now, you would have to add new blog posts and update the links individually and update the html which will get exhausting over time.
